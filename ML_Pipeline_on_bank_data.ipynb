    "### _Business Scenario_\n",
    "\n",
    "There has been a revenue decline for the Portuguese bank and they would like to know what actions to take. After investigation, we found out that the root cause is that their clients are not depositing as frequently as before. Knowing that term deposits allow banks to hold onto a deposit for a specific amount of time, so banks can invest in higher gain financial products to make a profit. In addition, banks also hold better chance to persuade term deposit clients into buying other products such as funds or insurance to further increase their revenues. As a result, the Portuguese bank would like to identify existing clients that have higher chance to subscribe for a term deposit and focus marketing effort on such clients.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* The task is to build a POC for the problem\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution. \n",
    "\n",
    "* The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. \n",
